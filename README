CAVEAT
    The following README is included, with one exception, in it's
    original form and text.  The only change I've made is the removal
    of the project which "inspired" it.  Please enjoy the product of
    arrogance that can only come with youth.

NAME
    FreeRipper - rip pages from external sites to include in user pages

INSTALLATION
    Installation is simple and straight forward and discussed at the top of
    the FreeRipper script.

DESCRIPTION
    FreeRipper allows you to fetch and use HTML from other web sites
    directly on your site. You simply supply the URL and the starting and
    ending points to start fetching in minutes

    Advantages of FreeRipper over similar scripts (such as [REDACTED] at
    [REDACTED]):

    experience
        FreeRipper was written by someone who actually knows Perl.

    portability
        FreeRipper is compatible with mod_perl and 'use strict'

    efficiency
        FreeRipper doesn't go through the trouble of reading, parsing, and
        processing POST data (that isn't there) and then never even
        _attempt_ to use it.

    efficiency (cont'd)
        FreeRipper doesn't have numerous pointless page-wide regex
        substitutions that would be unnecessary had the author any idea of
        how to use regex's.

    ethics =)
        FreeRipper doesn't tell you that removal of the pathetic link back
        to the script's home will break the script. As a matter of fact,
        there _is_ no extra output with FreeRipper!

NOTES
    This copylefted script may be duplicated and sold without or without
    written permission from anyone.

    This software is available to do whatever you want with. Change names,
    butcher the Perl, or turn it into a hacker script. The only condition is
    that I'm not responsible for anything that happens to any code or system
    after the tarball is opened.
